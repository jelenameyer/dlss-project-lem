# DLSS Final Project: Legis ex Machina

Important: All work until 06.08.2025 (12:00) was done in Repo https://github.com/EstelleKlevenz/dlss-legis-ex-machina. 

We opened and finalized in this second Git Repository due  to lfs size constraints.

In the code folder, all files are logically named in numerical order and can (with a lot of computing power) be executed one after the other in the specified order to obtain the final test results.
Some of the intermediate data objects and model weights are not saved in the new repository version due to their large size but can all be obtained by running the corresponding codebooks.


## ToDo till Deadline:

for @Elena und @Pascal

code:
- cleanup script 0.0/0.1_handle_speeches.ipynb
- cleanup script 3.0/3.1_Generator... (or rather do we need both)
- Pascal: add all analyses to sentiment under "4.2_validation_via_Sentiment_Analysis.ipanb"

data:
- cleanup generated_speeches_data (keep only CSVs that we need)
- what is "test_speeches_by_title.csv"?
- cleanup Wahl-O-Mat_results... (keep only CSVs that we need)


report:
- ! check for your names via search !
- finalize method section 4.2 with all subsections
    - explain prompts
- proofread results section 5.0-5.2, check if I have referenced your models correctly and interpreted it according to what you think
- Pascal: write section 5.3
- proofread Discussion section, again check my interpretations of your models
- Pascal: add Discussion part of results 5.3 to Discssion
- proofread all and check if anything is missing/inconclusive
- include exemplary paragraphs of generated speeches? maybe in appendix?

f√ºr @Estelle
- final proofreading
- send to Giordano

And then we are done! :)
