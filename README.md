# DLSS Final Project: Legis ex Machina

Important: All work until 06.08.2025 (12:00) was done in Repo https://github.com/EstelleKlevenz/dlss-legis-ex-machina. 

We opened and finalized in this second Git Repository due  to lfs size constraints.

In the code folder, all files are logically named in numerical order and can (with a lot of computing power) be executed one after the other in the specified order to obtain the final test results.
